The purpose of this example is to show the execution of the program for cases where there is more than one function and whose complexity is different from the ones demonstrated in the previous examples. If the code in the file is accepted by the chosen regex, such as "AC(BC)*(D|E)F", it is expected a successful result. Otherwise, the result is expected to be unsuccessful.
