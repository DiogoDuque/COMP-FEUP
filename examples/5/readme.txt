The purpose of this example is to show the execution of the program for simple cases where there is more than one function. If the code in the file is accepted by the chosen regex, such as "ABC(D)?(E(F)?)*G?(H|I)J", it is expected a successful result. Otherwise, the result is expected to be unsuccessful.
